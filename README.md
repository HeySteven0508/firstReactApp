# My Very first React Project

Created in React JS for the front end and Fake REST API JSON Server for the backend.
if you want to know about JSON SERVER click [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

To run the program type first **"npm install"**
then run the server side JSON to fetch the data by simply typing **"npm run server"** (the syntax is already written in script in json.package)
then last but not the the least is to deploy the react app by typing **"npm start"**.

Enjoy!
